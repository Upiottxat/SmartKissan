      "Infected leaves often drop prematurely."
    ],
    "cause": "Caused by the fungus Venturia inaequalis, which thrives in cool, wet spring weather. The fungus overwinters in infected leaves on the ground and releases spores during spring rains.",
    "cure": {
      "organic": [
        "Clean up and destroy fallen leaves in the autumn to reduce overwintering spores.",
        "Prune trees to improve air circulation and allow leaves to dry faster.",

      "Small, purple spots on leaves that enlarge to form 'frogeye leaf spot'.",
      "Reddish-brown, sunken cankers on branches."
    ],
    "cause": "Caused by the fungus Diplodia seriata (previously Botryosphaeria obtusa). It infects dead wood, cankers, and mummified fruit, releasing spores during wet weather.",
    "cure": {
      "organic": [
        "Prune out dead or diseased branches and cankers during winter dormancy.",
        "Remove and destroy all mummified fruit from the tree and the ground.",
        "Maintain tree health with proper watering and fertilization to resist infection."

  "Corn Common Rust": {
    "symptoms": [
      "Small, cinnamon-brown, powdery pustules on both upper and lower leaf surfaces.",
      "Pustules are oval or elongated and scattered across the leaves.",
      "Can also appear on stalks and husks in severe cases."
    ],
    "cause": "Caused by the fungus Puccinia sorghi. Spores are carried by wind over long distances. It's favored by cool temperatures (16-23Â°C) and high humidity.",
    "cure": {
      "organic": [
        "Plant resistant corn hybrids, which is the most effective management method.",
        "Avoid dense planting to promote air circulation and reduce humidity within the crop canopy."
      ],
      "chemical": [
        "Foliar fungicides (e.g., containing Pyraclostrobin, Azoxystrobin) can be effective if applied early when rust is first detected, especially on susceptible hybrids."

  "Potato Late Blight": {
    "symptoms": [
      "Large, dark brown to black lesions on leaves and stems, often appearing water-soaked.",
      "A white, fuzzy ring of fungal growth may appear on the underside of leaves at the lesion edge, especially in humid conditions.",
      "Tubers develop a reddish-brown, dry, firm rot under the skin."
    ],
    "cause": "Caused by the water mold Phytophthora infestans. It thrives in cool, moist conditions. Spores are spread by wind and rain from infected plants or cull piles.",
    "cure": {
      "organic": [
        "Plant certified disease-free seed potatoes.",
        "Ensure good air circulation and water the soil, not the foliage.",
        "Prophylactically apply copper-based fungicides before symptoms appear, especially when cool, wet weather is forecast."
      ],
      "chemical": [
        "Apply fungicides containing Chlorothalonil or Mancozeb. Alternate between different fungicide groups to prevent resistance. Begin applications before disease onset."

  "Tomato Late Blight": {
    "symptoms": [
      "Large, dark, water-soaked spots on leaves that turn brown/black.",

      "Stems develop large black lesions.",
      "Fruit develops large, firm, greasy-looking, dark brown spots."
    ],
    "cause": "Same as Potato Late Blight (Phytophthora infestans). It spreads rapidly in cool, wet weather and can destroy an entire crop in a short time.",
    "cure": {
      "organic": [
        "Remove and destroy infected plants immediately (do not compost).",
        "Ensure wide spacing for air circulation.",
        "Apply copper-based fungicides or bio-fungicides (Bacillus subtilis) preventatively."
      ],
      "chemical": [
        "Apply protectant fungicides like Mancozeb or Chlorothalonil before the disease starts. Curative fungicides may be needed in a severe outbreak."

  "Tomato Yellow Leaf Curl Virus": {
    "symptoms": [
      "Stunting of the plant.",

      "Leaves become smaller and may feel leathery.",
      "Significant reduction in flower and fruit production."
    ],
    "cause": "A virus (TYLCV) transmitted exclusively by the silverleaf whitefly. The whitefly acquires the virus by feeding on an infected plant and then transmits it to healthy plants.",
    "cure": {
      "organic": [
        "There is no cure for an infected plant; it must be removed and destroyed immediately to prevent spread.",
        "Control whiteflies by using reflective mulch (silver plastic) or introducing beneficial insects like lacewings.",
        "Use floating row covers on young plants to prevent whiteflies from reaching them.",
        "Spray with insecticidal soap or neem oil to manage whitefly populations."
      ],
      "chemical": [
        "Control of the whitefly vector is key. Use systemic insecticides containing Imidacloprid on young, non-fruiting plants. For fruiting plants, use insecticides like spiromesifen."
